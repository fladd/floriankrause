## Large-scale brain networks & stress

I recently got interested in the clinical benefits of self-regulating
large-scale brain networks using real-time functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback. In my current position as a postdoctoral
researcher in the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience lab of Erno Hermans at
the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour at Radboudumc,
I am investigating how to capture shifts in large-scale brain network
blance for developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback training interventions
to increase stress resilience.

## Real-time fMRI & neurofeedback

When working on the European BRAINTRAIN project as a postdoctoral researcher
for Rainer Goebel at Brain Innovation B.V. and Maastricht University, I
started exploring how the self-regulation of brain networks by (combined)
Electroencephalography (EEG) and especially real-time fMRI (rtfMRI)
neurofeedback can be methodologically further advanced to be utilised as a
therapeutic measure for mental disorders.

## Embodied cognition & numerical cognition

During my PhD at the Donders Institute at Radboud University,
with Harold Bekkering, Ivan Toni and Oliver Lindemann,
I got concerned with the question of how former
sensorimotor experiences shape our cognition and how differences in these
experiences can lead to individual traits in cognitive functions. My research
focuses on the neurocognitive representation of numerical magnitude
and the question of whether numerical concepts are "grounded" in former
sensorimotor experiences with size in everyday life. I address these issues by
investigating human adults and children, using an integrated empirical approach
which combines a variety of behavioural measures (e.g. reaction time,
kinematics) as well as neuroimaging techniques (e.g. fMRI, Voxel-Based
Morphometry).
