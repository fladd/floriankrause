title: About me
---

I am a researcher in Cognitive Neuroscience working for [RadboudUMC](https://radboudumc.nl) at the [Donders Institute](https://ru.nl/donders) in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

My main research interests include real-time fMRI, neurofeedback, stress, embodied cognition and numerical cognition.

I am also the main developer of [Expyriment](http://www.expyriment.org), a Python library for designing and conducting timing-critical bahavioural and neuroimaging experiments.
