title: Hi there!

I am a researcher in Cognitive Neuroscience, currently working in the [Cognitive Affective Neuroscience lab](http://www.ernohermans.com) at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

My main research interests include real-time fMRI, neurofeedback, stress, embodied cognition and numerical cognition.

I am also the main developer of [Expyriment](http://www.expyriment.org), a Python library for designing and conducting timing-critical bahavioural and neuroimaging experiments.
